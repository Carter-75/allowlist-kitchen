// Three sizes of the same week (added Nov 5, 2026 at Carter's request).
// The 21 meals above are the 2,500-calorie plan, Carter's own. Every meal
// keeps the same ingredients at every size; only the amounts change.
// Carter's ranges: a plan is on target anywhere in 1,350-1,650 (the 1,500),
// 1,850-2,150 (the 2,000), or 2,350-2,650 (the 2,500) calories a day.
// Beef rule (Carter, Nov 5, 2026): beef is portioned raw in quarter-pound
// multiples at EVERY size, 0.25 lb (4 oz) a meal and 0.5 lb (8 oz) for the
// double meatloaf, never odd ounces. The 2,500 and 2,000 plans both run the
// full 84 oz beef pool that way (the 2,000 scales eggs, fruit, and tallow
// instead of beef). At the 1,500 size, 20 beef meals at a 0.25 lb minimum
// would floor the day around 1,930 calories, outside the range, so Carter
// directed the fix himself: keep the beef in quarter pounds (40 oz a week,
// at 9 meals) and adjust the other 11 beef recipes at this size to run on
// their eggs, sardines, salmon, and cheese, with their own names,
// descriptions, and steps in the overrides below.
// Label-checked daily averages (rebuilt Nov 6, 2026 with the approved raw
// cheddar in place of the never-approved mozzarella, Bob's Red Mill flax
// label values, and exact product prices): 2,500 plan: 2,615 cal, 143g
// protein, 188g fat, 102g carbs, 31.2g fiber. 2,000 plan: 2,134 cal, 125g
